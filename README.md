# UW-BootCamp-Chalange-4-The-Coder-s-Quiz

## Description

This is a Quiz game. I created this so I could chalange my firends to quizes and compete to get the best score. I learned that creating random generators without jQuery is 
very mentaily chalanging, how to make random generators that don't repete elements, and how to call and style elments using javascript to fit my needs.

## Installation
Theroiticly there is no instalation needed, but if you would like to custamize the questions then after you download the files, you would simply need to change the
questionsAnswers, bluffAnswers, resetQuestions, and resetBluffAnswers sections to you liking.

##Usage
This website has only two main features. The first feature is the game. The game gives you 90 second to answer 5 multiple choice questions randomly picked from a object,
it also randomly picks 3 bluff answers form the provided bluffs to try to thow you off. In the span of one game you won't have any repeate questions, and there will be
no duplicate answer options. If you pick the wrong answer then you will lose some time. Spam the page and you also lose time. If you complete the quiz before your time 
runs out you will get to experiance the second feature, tracking your scores. After a "win" you get to track your remaining time along with your chosen title.
